## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ Publicis Groupe (_May 2024 - Present_)**
- Conducted comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and integration on an Excel dataset sourced from 
Salesforces, resolving issues with dirty data to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
- Reduced time spent on report generation by saving ~90 hours of monthly labor costs and improved the 
accuracy of reporting by 30% through the development and automation of reports and dashboards using 
VBA, Power BI and Tableau.
- Aggregated +10 Million data from over 20 sources to build the foundation of a new product led to an 80% 
increase in accuracy using Phyton and SQL.
- Optimized over 10 SQL queries runtime resulting in 20% improved performance in report load time, finding 
& reporting data trends, bottlenecks & edge cases weekly and proposing & implementing solutions.


**Security Supervisor Analyst @ Trinseo Altuglas (_June 2023 - May 2024_)**
- Analyzed and interpreted complex data sets, developing and implementing data collection system to identify 
correlation between company vulnerability to various hazards and the probability of happening.
- Worked on the Risk Assessment Report to prevent and protect the companyâ€™s assets, thru data driven 
investigation, collaborating with employees, firemen, technicians, insurers and engineers. 
- Performed building and roving patrols, prepared incident reports and taking recommended appropriate 
follow up actions; responded to alarms and dispatched calls; decided what actions to take based on the 
situation, facts are known, and position limitations.
- Cultivated open lines of communication with security staff, supervision, and clients optimized management 
development and implementation of updated security protocols to address fire and criminal hazards.


**Firefighter @ Ministry of the Interior (_Genuary 2020 - February 2023_)**
- Managed to quickly and firmly response to life threatening situation, collaborating with a team of +7 firemen 
to coordinating the intervention and prevent any possibility of dangerous casualties, protecting the 
population and the city assets.
- Demonstrated exceptional time management and prioritization skills, executing multiple calls with efficiency 
and precision, increasing the readiness of 80%.
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to develop and deliver training programs for new hires, improving 
the knowledge and skill set of team members by over 30%.
- Worked with 11 volunteers and 14 full-time firefighters to reorganize fire station, reducing response time by 
3 minutes.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
