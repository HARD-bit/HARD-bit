## Projects

### Red Cross Bolzano Patient Booking & Routing System
#### Description:
This project, developed during a hackathon, aims to assist the Red Cross of Bolzano in optimizing their patient transportation service. The system is built with a Python-based backend and integrates a series of technologies to streamline the booking and routing process for medical transport.

#### Key Features:
Patient Booking: The system registers relevant patient booking details (such as appointment time, date, and specific needs) into a CSV file for easy access and management.

Routing Algorithm: A routing algorithm is used to determine the optimal path for each vehicle. It takes into account various factors, including:

Similar patient profiles (same day, same time range)
Specific disabilities or mobility needs
Historical booking data for efficient vehicle allocation.
Web Application (Dash): A user-friendly web interface built using Dash allows Red Cross personnel to:

View the optimal routes on an interactive map.
Access detailed patient booking information.
Log in securely to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the data.
#### Technologies Used:
Python: Backend development and routing logic.
Dash: Frontend web application to visualize routes and booking data.
CSV: Data storage for booking information.
This project improves the efficiency of the Red Cross transportation service by providing optimized routes based on patient needs, helping reduce travel time and costs while improving service delivery.

### Automotive Market Data Analysis

#### Description:
In this project, I developed a code-based solution to extract and analyze key information related to the automotive market. The objective was to gather relevant data from various sources, process it, and generate insights into market trends, consumer preferences, and competitive landscapes.

Using the SQL programming languages, applied on Data Cloud System like Salesforces, I implemented data scraping techniques to collect information on vehicle models, pricing, sales figures, and other industry-specific metrics. The data was then cleaned, organized, and analyzed to identify patterns and opportunities within the automotive sector.

The final outcome was a set of visualizations and reports that provided a clear overview of the market's current state and potential future developments. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of the automotive industry's dynamics.

#### Skills and Tools: 
Data Scraping, SQL, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Automotive Industry Insights
