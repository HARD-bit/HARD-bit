## Projects
### Automotive Market Data Analysis

#### Description:
In this project, I developed a code-based solution to extract and analyze key information related to the automotive market. The objective was to gather relevant data from various sources, process it, and generate insights into market trends, consumer preferences, and competitive landscapes.

Using the SQL programming languages, applied on Data Cloud System like Salesforces, I implemented data scraping techniques to collect information on vehicle models, pricing, sales figures, and other industry-specific metrics. The data was then cleaned, organized, and analyzed to identify patterns and opportunities within the automotive sector.

The final outcome was a set of visualizations and reports that provided a clear overview of the market's current state and potential future developments. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of the automotive industry's dynamics.
