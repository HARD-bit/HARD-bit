- Aggregated +10 Million data from over 20 sources to build the foundation of a new product led to an 80% 
increase in accuracy using Phyton and SQL.
- Optimized over 10 SQL queries runtime resulting in 20% improved performance in report load time, finding 
& reporting data trends, bottlenecks & edge cases weekly and proposing & implementing solutions.


**Security Supervisor Analyst @ Trinseo Altuglas (_June 2023 - May 2024_)**
- Analyzed and interpreted complex data sets, developing and implementing data collection system to identify 
correlation between company vulnerability to various hazards and the probability of happening.
- Worked on the Risk Assessment Report to prevent and protect the companyâ€™s assets, thru data driven 
investigation, collaborating with employees, firemen, technicians, insurers and engineers. 
- Performed building and roving patrols, prepared incident reports and taking recommended appropriate 
follow up actions; responded to alarms and dispatched calls; decided what actions to take based on the 
situation, facts are known, and position limitations.
- Cultivated open lines of communication with security staff, supervision, and clients optimized management 
development and implementation of updated security protocols to address fire and criminal hazards.


**Firefighter @ Ministry of the Interior (_Genuary 2020 - February 2023_)**
- Managed to quickly and firmly response to life threatening situation, collaborating with a team of +7 firemen 
to coordinating the intervention and prevent any possibility of dangerous casualties, protecting the 
population and the city assets.
- Demonstrated exceptional time management and prioritization skills, executing multiple calls with efficiency 
and precision, increasing the readiness of 80%.

## Projects
### Automotive Market Data Analysis

#### Description:
In this project, I developed a code-based solution to extract and analyze key information related to the automotive market. The objective was to gather relevant data from various sources, process it, and generate insights into market trends, consumer preferences, and competitive landscapes.

Using the SQL programming languages, applied on Data Cloud System like Salesforces, I implemented data scraping techniques to collect information on vehicle models, pricing, sales figures, and other industry-specific metrics. The data was then cleaned, organized, and analyzed to identify patterns and opportunities within the automotive sector.

The final outcome was a set of visualizations and reports that provided a clear overview of the market's current state and potential future developments. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of the automotive industry's dynamics.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
